Hey Hey 

My name is Moe, but I go by Drew. 

I wanted to start this GitHub account as a time capsule journal. 

I will post all the programs I make, no matter how small or big, even if it's just a small program that adds two numbers together. 

If you're an employer seeing this, welcome! 
If you like what you see, shoot me an email at 
mohammadali.tagh@gmail.com


For Now, I will be learning python as my first language. 
I aim to create the PayPal of crypto and soon shake hands with Elon Musk over a business deal.
