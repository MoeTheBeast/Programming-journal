# Programming-journal
This is a journal of the journey into learning programming 


These files are just exercises that I'm doing using:
https://pynative.com/python-basic-exercise-for-beginners/   

I find it to be a good way of learning programming, it's a bit more hard core as there is no videos and it's just straight up trying and reading.

Im starting to struggle heavily with each exercise but it is what it is, if I'm not struggling , then I am not learning :)

Goal is to do at least one exercise per day.
